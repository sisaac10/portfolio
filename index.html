  <p><b>Selected Technical Projects</b><br class="small">
  <b>Software-Defined Network Firewall</b><br class="small">
  Created an externally configurable firewall using an OpenFlow enabled switch. This means the firewall rules are provided in a configuration file, so they<br class="small">
  can be changed without altering the switch code. I developed a firewall policy configuration file using Python and Pyretic code that contained a variety<br class="small">
  of firewall rules. Example – One common implementation for a virtual private network solution utilizes PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol). It now<br class="small">
  has many issues related to the way it authenticates users. Write a firewall policy rule to block PPTP that will prohibit all hosts from accessing a PPTP<br class="small">
  server running on server2.</p>
  <br class="small">
  
  <p><b>Distance Vector Routing Protocol</b><br class="small">
  Distance vector routing protocols use a fully distributed algorithm that finds shortest paths by solving the Bellman-Ford equation at each node. For this<br class="small">
  project I developed a distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm in Python to calculate routing paths in a network. While running a simulation of a network<br class="small"> 
  topology where nodes represented individual Autonomous Systems (ASes), the distance vector routing protocol had to make decisions based on<br class="small"> 
  business relationships and hop count. Weighted links and negatively weighted links were used in the network topology to reflect the business<br class="small"> 
  relationships between ASes.</p>
