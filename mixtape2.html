  <p><b>Music</b></p>

  <p>I heard someone else describe this as J-Pop meets Slipknot. Ultimately, it just needs to be seen to be believed.</p>
  <p> This performance was my introduction and it is probably a good one for everyone else as well.</p>

  <p>Just stumbled on this. I love these looping musicians that can be one person bands thanks to technology.</p>
  <p>I had another Nirvana cover on the last mixtape but even though I haven't listened to them in ages, their songs last the test of time</p>

  <p>Just bass, drums, and vocals. Sometimes less is more when you know what you're doing</p>

  <p>I'm a Fiona Apple fan, this reminds of her a bit. Also, I used to play Double Bass, so respect for anyone who can play it well.</p>

  <p><b>Environment</b></p>
  <p>One of my favorite videos ever. All the feelings. <a href = "http://www.lionwhisperer.co.za/" target = "_blank">Kevin Richardson</a> articulates so many important ideas in this video. </p>
  <p>One idea that Kevin stresses in the video is, "Habitat. Habitat. Habitat." Habitat loss is hurting our wildlife everywhere.</p>
  <p>I will try and post as much information as I can about helping to restore habitat and supporting related causes like wildlife corridors.</p>

  <p>This NOVA documentary explains in better detail why wildlife corridors are important.</p>
