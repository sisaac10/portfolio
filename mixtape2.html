  <p><b>Mixtape 2</b> <a href = "https://sisaac10.github.io/work/mixtape.html" target = "_blank">Mixtape 1</a></p>
  <p>When I was younger I used to make mixtapes for friends. This series of posts will act as a different kind of mixtape for miscellaneous</p>
  <p>interests, such as shows, music, websites, or articles that I want to write about or recommend.</p>
  <p>You can go back to my <a href = "https://sisaac10.github.io/work/" target = "_blank">Main Portfolio Page</a> to see academic and professional work samples.</p>

  <p>I heard someone else describe this as J-Pop meets Slipknot. Ultimately, it just needs to be seen to be believed.</p>
  <p> This performance was my introduction and it is probably a good one for everyone else as well.</p>

  <p>This is pretty amazing. I love these looping musicians that can be one person bands thanks to technology.</p>
  <p>I had another Nirvana cover on the last mixtape and even though I haven't listened to them in ages, it shows how their</p>
  <p>songs last the test of time.</p>

  <p><b>Education</b></p>
  <p>This is closest thing I could show anyone to help them understand what my time as a teacher was like.</p>
  <p>I was teaching computers and technology but my experience was very similar to Emily and Matt. If you want to understand</p>
  <p> what it is like to do something innovative with education and the challenges that come with it, then watch this documentary.</p>

  <p>Here is Emily talking about what <a href = "http://www.projecthdesign.org/" target = "_blank">Project H</a> has grown into since the end of the documentary.</p>
